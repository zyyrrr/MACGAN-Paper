# MACGAN-Paper
Realization of paper: “An Adversarial Learning Model for Intrusion Detection in Real Complex Network Environments”

## Introduction
The idea is to use a generative adversarial network (GAN) based algorithm to generate adversarial malicious examples, which are able to bypass the existing advanced anomaly detection algorithm.

## Dependencies
 ```pytorch 1.0```
 
## Datasets
Two data sets, Kitsune and CICIDS 2017, are used in this paper to evaluate the performance of our scheme.

## Demo Code
A demo script is provided in wgan_mirai.py.
```
%run wgan_mirai.py
```
